    Challenge: Clone this project https://github.com/Ibaslogic/react-todo-project and write an end-to-end
(E2E) test for the most important parts using https://www.cypress.io/.
    Solution: through the terminal go to the react-todo-project directory and host the web page by using the comand "npm start".
Then, through another terminal, go to the cypess directory and use the comand "npx cypress open" to be able to use cypess to test the
web pages functionalities. Once you open cypress, click "E2E testing", select a browser (Google Chrome works best), click "start E2E testing"
and then select the code that will be used to test the initial web page. In this case the code is spec.cy.js
