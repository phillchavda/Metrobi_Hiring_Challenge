Challenge: Present and explain the concept of “Nash Equilibrium” in such a way that a 5-year-old can understand what it means.

Imagine 2 people are playing a game and the rule is the first person to cross the bridge wins $100, but if 2 people are one the bridge at
the same time it will break and both players will die.


Both players will have the same plan, because they are rational. Their plan will be to cross the bridge while there is no one else on it.


If player 1 is faster and starts crossing first, player 2 will not change his plan. he will not try to cross at the same time,
because then he will die and will never be able to win $100.


If player 1 isn't able to get to the bridge first, player 2 will follow his plan and cross while there is no one on it. If he changes his plan
and decides to wait a bit player 2 might be able to cross before him and win the money.


Whenever there is a situation with 2 or more people and no one will change their strategy depending on what the others do,
the chosen strategies are part of something called a Nash equilibrium.
